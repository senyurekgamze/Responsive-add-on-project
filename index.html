            <h3>
              Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
              <cite class="cite">Leonardo da Vinci</cite>
            </h3>

            <p>
              "So what is this minimalism thing? It’s quite simple: to be a
              minimalist you must live with less than 100 things, you can’t own
              a car or a home or a television, you can’t have a career, you must
              live in exotic hard-to-pronounce places all over the world...
            </p>

            <p>
              Okay, we’re joking—obviously. But people who dismiss minimalism as
              some sort of fad usually mention any of the above “restrictions”
              as to why they could “never be a minimalist.” Minimalism isn’t
              about any of those things, but it can help you accomplish them. If
              you desire to live with fewer material possessions, or jettison
              your car and television, or travel all over the world, then
              minimalism can lend a hand. But that’s not the point.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom.
              Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm.
              Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the
              trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around.
              Real freedom. That doesn’t mean there’s anything inherently wrong
              with owning material possessions. Today’s problem seems to be the
              meaning we assign to stuff: we assign too much meaning to things,
              often forsaking our health, our relationships, our passions, our
              personal growth, and our desire to contribute beyond ourselves.
              Want to own a car or a house? Great, have at it! Want to raise a
              family and have a career? If these things are important to you,
              that’s wonderful. Minimalism simply allows you to make these
              decisions more deliberately."
