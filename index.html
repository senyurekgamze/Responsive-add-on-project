            <h2>What is Minimalisim?</h2>
            <h3>
              Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
              <cite class="cite">Leonardo da Vinci</cite>
            </h3>

            <p>
              "So what is this minimalism thing? It’s quite simple: to be a
              minimalist you must live with less than 100 things, you can’t own
              a car or a home or a television, you can’t have a career, you must
              live in exotic hard-to-pronounce places all over the world...
            </p>

            <p>
              Okay, we’re joking—obviously. But people who dismiss minimalism as
              some sort of fad usually mention any of the above “restrictions”
              as to why they could “never be a minimalist.” Minimalism isn’t
              about any of those things, but it can help you accomplish them. If
              you desire to live with fewer material possessions, or jettison
              your car and television, or travel all over the world, then
              minimalism can lend a hand. But that’s not the point.
            </p>

            <p>
              Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom.
              Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry. Freedom from overwhelm.
              Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the
              trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around.
              Real freedom. That doesn’t mean there’s anything inherently wrong
              with owning material possessions. Today’s problem seems to be the
              meaning we assign to stuff: we assign too much meaning to things,
              often forsaking our health, our relationships, our passions, our
              personal growth, and our desire to contribute beyond ourselves.
              Want to own a car or a house? Great, have at it! Want to raise a
              family and have a career? If these things are important to you,
              that’s wonderful. Minimalism simply allows you to make these
              decisions more deliberately."

                <p>
                  Having less stuff is the key to happiness: Do you ever feel
                  overwhelmed, instead of overjoyed, by all your possessions? Do
                  you secretly wish a gale force wind would blow the clutter
                  from your home? If so, it's time to simplify your life! The
                  Joy of Less is a fun, lighthearted guide to minimalist living.

                <h4>Goodbye, things</h4>
                <p>
                  In Goodbye, Things Sasaki modestly shares his personal
                  minimalist experience, offering specific tips on the
                  minimizing process and revealing how the new minimalist
                  movement can not only transform your space but truly enrich
                  your life. The benefits of a minimalist life can be realized
                  by anyone, and Sasaki's humble vision of true happiness will
                  open your eyes to minimalism's potential.

                <h5>Author: Fumio Sasaki</h5>
                <p>
                  Fumio Sasaki is not an enlightened minimalism expert or
                  organizing guru like Marie Kondo--he's just a regular guy who
                  was stressed out and constantly comparing himself to others,
                  until one day he decided to change his life by saying goodbye
                  to everything he didn't absolutely need. The effects were
                  remarkable: Sasaki gained true freedom, new focus, and a real
                  sense of gratitude for everything around him.
